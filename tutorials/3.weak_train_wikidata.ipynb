    "A retriever has to know the correct path from the question entities to answer entities. A traditional approach for collecting training data thus is to manually annotate a reasoning path in the knowledge graph. Such annotation is much more complex than traditional annotation tasks such as classification. It is also very expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach to generate training data is **distant supervision**. In this setting, given question entities and answer entities, we use the shortest path between them as the reasoning path. This is a reasonable assumption because the shortest path is often the most relevant path. This approach is much cheaper than manual annotation and can be easily scaled to large datasets.\n",
